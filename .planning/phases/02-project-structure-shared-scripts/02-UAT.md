## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. resolveModulePath API available
expected: The resolveModulePath() function is exported from .claude/shared/scripts/load-config.mjs and can be imported in test code
result: pass

### 2. requireNonEmptyModules guards empty config
expected: Calling requireNonEmptyModules() with an empty modules field throws an error with '/using-qa-flow init' guidance message
result: pass

### 3. config.casesRoot defaults to 'cases/'
expected: When casesRoot field is absent from config.json, resolveModulePath() uses 'cases/' as the default root directory
result: pass

### 4. Cases directory structure scaffolded
expected: The directories cases/requirements/, cases/xmind/, cases/archive/, and cases/history/ exist with .gitkeep files
result: pass

### 5. repo-branch-mapping.yaml migrated
expected: File .claude/repo-branch-mapping.yaml exists and config/ directory no longer exists
result: pass

### 6. build-archive-index refactored
expected: build-archive-index.mjs runs successfully without hardcoded 'cases/archive' string literals and uses config-driven paths
result: pass

### 7. audit-md-frontmatter refactored
expected: audit-md-frontmatter.mjs runs successfully without hardcoded 'cases/' string literals and uses config.casesRoot
result: pass

### 8. md-content-source-resolver refactored
expected: md-content-source-resolver.mjs uses resolveModulePath() and module.repoHints[] instead of DEFAULT_REPO_HINT_KEYS_BY_PRODUCT
result: pass

### 9. unify-directory-structure simplified
expected: unify-directory-structure.mjs is a generic ~60-line config-driven scaffold with no DTStack migration logic, and runs without errors
result: pass

### 10. Hardcoded-path regression test passes
expected: Running 'node .claude/tests/test-no-hardcoded-paths.mjs' exits with code 0 and reports zero forbidden hardcoded path literals
result: pass

### 11. Full test suite is green
expected: Running 'node .claude/tests/run-all.mjs' shows 16 test files passing with zero new regressions compared to baseline
result: issue
reported: "17 test files run; 2 failures detected. Failures are in Phase 04 work (test-archive-history-scripts.mjs: XYZH route path; prd-enhancer formalized file retention). Phase 02 baseline (16 files) all pass. Exit code 0."
severity: minor

## Gaps

- truth: "Running 'node .claude/tests/run-all.mjs' shows 16 test files passing with zero new regressions compared to baseline"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: 17 test files run; 2 failures detected. Failures are in Phase 04 work (test-archive-history-scripts.mjs: XYZH route path; prd-enhancer formalized file retention). Phase 02 baseline (16 files) all pass. Exit code 0."
  severity: minor
  test: 11
  root_cause: "Phase 04-02 and 04-03 commits changed archive-converter and prd-enhancer behavior without updating corresponding tests. (1) feat(04-02) made json-to-archive-md.mjs config-driven but XYZH route test still expects old path format. (2) feat(04-03) changed prd-enhancer SKILL.md wording so 'formalized file' assertion in test-formalized-prd-contract.mjs no longer matches. Phase 02 baseline (16 files) all passed at time of delivery."
