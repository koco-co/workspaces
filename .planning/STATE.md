## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from requirement categories and hard dependency order (generalization before any new feature)
- Roadmap: Playwright (AUTO-*) and Zentao (PROJ-*) deferred to v2 requirements — not in v1 roadmap
- Research: Config schema must be validated in Phase 1 (GEN-02) before any Phase 2+ work begins
- Research: DTStack data moves to dtstack-data branch, not deleted (backward compat constraint)
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: Doris/Hive/SparkThrift SQL collapsed into single ${datasource_type} template block in rules files
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: Java package->repo table deleted from repo-safety.md; config.stackTrace pointer added instead
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: Module key table replaced with generic ${module_key} template; actual list delegates to config.json
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: Hand-written validation in loadConfig() — no Ajv/Zod dependencies, matches zero-dep project preference
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: loadConfigFromPath(path) + resetConfigCache() exported for test isolation without module cache interference
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: getRepoBranchMappingPath() kept as deprecated alias for getBranchMappingPath() during transition
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: Replace DTStack/XYZH split-rule section in CLAUDE.md with conditional config.repos guard
- [Phase 01-generalization-refactor]: All repoBranchMapping references renamed to branchMapping; zentaoId renamed to trackerId; Doris/Hive/SparkThrift replaced with ${datasource_type} templates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (IM Notifications): DingTalk keyword edge-case behavior not fully confirmed by docs — include --dry-run validation step during planning
- Phase 4 research flag: Playwright integration (AUTO-01 to AUTO-07) is v2 scope; does not block current roadmap
